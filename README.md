## Problem Space

### The AI Revolution in Software Development

The advent of Generative AI has fundamentally transformed how software is built:

1. **Radical Productivity Gains**
   - 5-10x efficiency improvements in code generation
   - AI agents capable of completing entire tasks autonomously
   - Automated testing, documentation, and quality assurance
   - AI-assisted requirement definition and refinement

2. **Changed Nature of Work**
   - Traditional estimation models becoming obsolete
   - AI-ready tasks completed in minutes instead of days
   - Hybrid human-AI collaboration becoming standard
   - Growing divide between AI-proficient and traditional developers

3. **Market Pressures**
   - Competitors leveraging AI for faster delivery
   - Rising expectation of AI-enhanced productivity
   - Need to rethink traditional team structures
   - Opportunity cost of not adopting AI capabilities

### Core Teams vs. Resource Silos

A critical distinction exists between two concepts that are often conflated:

1. **Product Ownership & Continuity**
   - Core teams maintaining product vision and direction
   - Deep domain knowledge preservation
   - Consistent decision-making and prioritisation
   - Clear ownership of product quality and outcomes

2. **Resource Allocation & Delivery**
   - Traditional model locks skilled contributors into team silos
   - Resources trapped within team boundaries regardless of demand
   - AI capabilities amplify the cost of this inefficiency
   - Competitive disadvantage as market moves faster

The OpenUnited model maintains the benefits of core team ownership while breaking free from the limitations of team-based resource allocation. This separation is becoming critical as AI dramatically increases the productivity gap between efficient and inefficient resource allocation models.

### Hypothesized Benefits & Rationale

Based on observed patterns and logical analysis, we expect the simulation to demonstrate the following improvements:

1. **Resource Utilisation: +30-40%**
   - *Rationale*: Elimination of artificial team boundaries enables resources to flow to highest-value work
   - *Calculation*: Average 25% idle capacity in traditional teams + 15% sub-optimal allocation
   
2. **Time to Market: -50-60%**
   - *Rationale*: Combination of eliminated wait states and AI acceleration
   - *Factors*: No dependency queues (30% faster) + AI assistance (30% faster) = ~60% total improvement

3. **Cost Efficiency: +40-50%**
   - *Rationale*: Better matching of skills to tasks + AI leverage
   - *Components*: Reduced idle time (20%) + optimal skill matching (15%) + AI multiplication (15%)

4. **Quality Improvements: +25-35%**
   - *Rationale*: Specialists can contribute across products + AI-assisted validation
   - *Elements*: Expert reviews (15%) + AI checks (20%) = ~35% quality increase

5. **Innovation Rate: +100%**
   - *Rationale*: Cross-pollination of ideas + freed capacity for innovation
   - *Drivers*: Cross-team learning (40%) + reduced overhead (30%) + AI acceleration (30%)

6. **AI Leverage: +300-500%**
   - *Rationale*: Ability to deploy AI capabilities without team boundary friction
   - *Calculation*: Base AI gains (200%) Ã— improved resource flow (2-3x) = 400-600% increase

These hypotheses are based on:

1. **Task Execution Revolution**
   - Tasks that took days now take hours or minutes
   - AI agents can autonomously handle entire categories of work
   - Code generation, testing, and documentation can be largely automated
   - Quality improvements through AI-assisted review and refinement

2. **Work Definition Transformation**
   - AI helps standardise and clarify requirements
   - Automated validation of specifications
   - Rapid prototyping and iteration
   - Intelligent estimation and resource allocation

3. **Productivity Disparity**
   - Teams leveraging AI seeing 5-10x productivity gains
   - Growing gap between AI-proficient and traditional teams
   - Traditional productivity metrics becoming irrelevant
   - Need for new frameworks to measure and manage output

4. **Organisational Impact**
   - Fixed team structures limiting AI benefits
   - Need for flexible resource allocation to maximise AI leverage
   - Opportunity costs of delayed AI adoption
   - Competitive disadvantage for organisations stuck in traditional models

Even without considering the waste in traditional team structures, this AI revolution alone necessitates a fundamental rethinking of how we organise and allocate engineering resources. The marketplace model isn't just an optimisation - it's an essential evolution to fully capture the transformative potential of AI in software development.

### The Challenge of Traditional Engineering Teams

Organisations traditionally structure their engineering resources in rigid, team-specific silos. Each product or feature team typically maintains a fixed set of engineers (often 8-10 per team), leading to several systemic inefficiencies:

1. **Resource Imbalance & Dependency Gridlock**
   - Bottlenecked teams create organization-wide slowdowns
   - Teams with idle capacity can't help blocked teams they depend on
   - Critical cross-product features stall due to single team bottlenecks
   - Paradox of simultaneous idle capacity and overwhelming backlogs
   - Dependencies between products magnify the impact of team-specific bottlenecks
   - Specialized skills remain trapped within specific teams
   - Vicious cycle where blocked teams create more blocked teams

2. **Scaling Friction**
   - Adding new engineers takes 4-6 months (hiring + onboarding)
   - Teams can't quickly scale up for urgent projects
   - Resource redistribution across teams is politically challenging

3. **Knowledge Silos**
   - Expertise remains locked within specific teams
   - Cross-team collaboration is minimal
   - Best practices spread slowly across the organization

### Impact on Business Outcomes

These structural inefficiencies create measurable business impacts:

1. **Delayed Time-to-Market**
   - Features get stuck waiting for team capacity
   - Dependencies between teams create cascading delays
   - Innovation suffers due to resource constraints

2. **Increased Costs**
   - Teams maintain excess capacity "just in case"
   - Skilled engineers spend time on routine tasks
   - Knowledge transfer and onboarding costs are high

3. **Reduced Agility**
   - Organizations can't quickly respond to market opportunities
   - Resource reallocation is slow and politically charged
   - Innovation initiatives struggle to get required resources

## Current State Analysis

### Traditional Model Characteristics

1. **Fixed Team Structure**
   - 8 engineers per product team
   - ~6 effective working hours per day
   - Limited cross-team movement
   - Minimal AI assistance or automation

   - Significant idle time in some teams
   - Frequent dependency blockages
   - Limited optimization opportunities

## The OpenUnited Solution

### Marketplace Model Overview

OpenUnited proposes a revolutionary approach to engineering resource allocation through a dynamic marketplace model. Consider a scenario with 100 products - traditional allocation would assign 8 engineers to each product team (800 total). Instead, OpenUnited enables:

1. **Core + Pool Structure**
   - Small core team (2 engineers) per product for domain continuity
   - Remaining engineers form an elastic global pool
   - Pool size flexes based on overall demand
   - AI agents augment human capacity
   - Dynamic resource allocation driven by actual needs

For example, with 800 total engineers across 100 products:
- Traditional: Fixed 8 engineers per product
- OpenUnited: 2 core engineers per product (200 total) + 600 in elastic pool
- Future scaling: Core teams remain small while pool grows/shrinks with demand

2. **Bounty-Based Task System**
   - Tasks converted to bounties with point values
   - Clear specifications and acceptance criteria
   - AI-assisted task estimation and validation
   - Dynamic pricing based on urgency/complexity
